# Implementing the Speech-to-Text Model in Python and Tensorflow
![](speech_rec_logo.png)

We might be on the verge of having too many screens around us. It seems like every day, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction is voice interfaces.

TensorFlow released the Speech Commands [Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge). It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people. We’ll build a speech recognition system that understands simple spoken commands.

- The Demo video file has been uploaded as My Project.mp4
- Before downloading below Untitled1.ipynb file, you have to load all model checkpoints inside the script (Uploaded as model_checkpoints).
- Untitled1.ipynb : it's an python script which take your voice input and predict as in text.

#### Feel free to download and play with it :D
